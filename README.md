## About
A personal movie tracking and discovery application to be built with React and Node.js.
### Description and Purpose
SceneIt is a full-stack web application designed for film enthusiasts to log, rate, and discover movies. In a world with endless streaming options, SceneIt provides a centralized platform for users to manage their viewing history, build a backlog of films they want to watch, and share their opinions with a community.

### Inspiration
This project is inspired by popular platforms like Goodreads and Letterboxd. The goal was to build a complete application from the ground up, focusing on a clean user interface, a dynamic single-page application (SPA) experience, and a robust backend. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio project demonstrating mastery of full-stack development, from database design (including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships) to a feature-rich React frontend.


## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind

Backend: NodeJS, Express, Postgres, Render.
